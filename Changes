	* 0.10

	* New option "usebitsets":
	- When creating a TAP::DOM with new(usebitsets => 1) then all
	  the 'has_*' and 'is_*' attributes are stored in a common
	  bitset entry 'is_has' with their respective bits set.
	  This reduces the size of a TAP::DOM remarkably (by ~40%
	  for a large TAP-DOM) and is meant as an optimization
	  option for memory constrained problems.

	* Additional entry "tapdom_config" to store parse options

	* Data structure now with classes and accessors:
	- TAP::DOM::Entry -- all 'lines' entries
	  (with 'is_*' and 'has_*' attributes correctly handling bitsets)
	- TAP::DOM::Summary -- the aggregated 'summary' part
	- TAP::DOM::Config -- the 'tapdom_config' part

	* More tests and benchmarks for evaluating speed/memory footprint

	* Bummer! I shouldn't work too late at night... Using
	  Test::Harness features from the future is too bleading edge.

	* 0.06

	* New option "ignorelines" to strip unneccessary lines from the
 	  TAP that would otherwise just blow-up memory in the DOM.

	* distribution maintenance

	* 0.05

	* Allow to create more terse DOMs by accepting an "ignore" option
	  to declare items that should not be included.
