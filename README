NAME
    TAP::Data - TAP as a consistent data structure.

SYNOPSIS
        use TAP::Data 'tapdata';
        my $tapdata = tapdata( tap => $tap ); # same options as TAP::Parser
        print Dumper($tapdata);

DESCRIPTION

    The only purpose of this module is A) to define a reliable data
    structure and B) to help create this structure from TAP.

    That's useful when you want to analyze the TAP in detail with
    "data tools", e.g., I want to use it with Data::DPath.

    ``Reliable'' means that this structure is kind of an API that will
    not change, so your data tools (e.g. Data::DPath paths) can rely
    on it.
