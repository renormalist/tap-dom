NAME
    TAP::DOM - TAP as document data structure.

SYNOPSIS
    use TAP::DOM;
    use Data::Dumper;
    my $tapdata = new TAP::DOM ( tap => $tap ); # same options as TAP::Parser
    print Dumper($tapdata);

DESCRIPTION

    The purpose of this module is A) to define a reliable data
    structure and B) to help create this structure from TAP.

    That's useful when you want to analyze the TAP in detail with
    "data exploration tools", like Data::DPath.

    ``Reliable'' means that this structure is kind of an API that will
    not change, so your data exploration tools can rely on it.
